# Updated Portfolio

Here is an updated Portfolio built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. I wanted to have a simple approach with a little touch of things recently learned. Upadated resume and LinkedIn links on updated site.

# Under construction 

 1. Hopefully soon I can use javascript to enhance the site. At the moment, my skills are not there yet. There are somethings in my head I would like to try, like making an updated version of Lightbox.
 
2. I'm surprised on what Bootstrap can do, it has so many features that I can expand on.


### Prerequisites

Any web browser can access or view link, repository. Use source-code editor to view html javascript files.
