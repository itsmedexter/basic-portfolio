# Updated Portfolio

Here is an updated Portfolio built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. I wanted to have a simple approach with a little touch of things recently learned. Upadated resume and LinkedIn links on updated site.

## Always Under Construction 

 1. <link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" /> I have to remember to have this link properly set up. After a few hours of wondering why my external stylesheet wasn't working, it was missing "rel, type and /". For some reason it didn't work. When added, it worked.
 
 2. Hopefully soon I can use javascript to enhance the site. At the moment, my skills are not there yet. There are somethings in my head I would like to try, like making an updated version of Lightbox.
 
2. I'm surprised on what Bootstrap can do, it has so many features that I can expand on.
